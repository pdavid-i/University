A GUI Video Manager I made using Qt framework. It allows CRUD operations with Videos, and also creating
and playing playlists.

Notes:
	-Some features might require minor changes in code in order to work properly on your machine
	In HtmlWatchlist.h, line 41 you should type your own location for this project

	-I've divided the files into subdirectories just to make them more organized, so since 
	I'm not using a makefile you should have all the files in the same directory

	- I am using the "Windows.h" library, wich is a Windows-specific header file
