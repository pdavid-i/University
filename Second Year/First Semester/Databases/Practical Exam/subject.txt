--Create a database that allows the management of an Ocean exploration system. The entities in the system are:
--Teams, Oceans, Ships and Sensors. An Ocean has a name and an average depth. A Ship has a capacity, a name and
--belongs to only one team. A team has a name and can own multiple ships. Sensors have a serial id, the longitude
--and latitude of their location, the Ocean they were deployed in, and the Team that owns them. Sensors gather
--data about the ocean waves, such as height, propagation, period and propagation. You have to:
--a) Design a suiting database for this task
--b) Create a procedure that takes as parameters a serial Id, an ocean, a team name, a latitude and longitude
--   and adds a sensor to the database  
--c) Create a view of all the teams that have sensors in the Arctic Ocean but not in the Pacific
--d) Create a procedure that returns the oceans ordered based on their wavelength
