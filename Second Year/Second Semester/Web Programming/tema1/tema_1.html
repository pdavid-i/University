<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Slint was an American rock band consisting of Brian McMahan (guitar and vocals), David Pajo (guitar), Britt Walford (drums and vocals), Todd Brashear (bass on Spiderland), and Ethan Buckler (bass on Tweez). They formed in Louisville, Kentucky, United States, in 1986. Slint's first album Tweez was recorded by engineer Steve Albini in 1987 and released in obscurity on the Jennifer Hartman Records label in 1989. It was followed two years later by the critically acclaimed Spiderland</p>

	<h4>Spiderland</h4>
	<p>Spiderland is the second and final studio album by the American rock band Slint. Although it was not widely recognized on its initial release, it eventually sold more than 50,000 copies and became a landmark album in underground music after Slint broke up. The album has been influential on the styles of many bands in the post-rock genres.</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> The band members were in their early 20's when they recorded this album, wich is astounding because it is (at least in my opinion) incredibly nuanced and complex. It is truly nothing short of a masterpiece</p>
